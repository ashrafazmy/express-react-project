# Resume API Project

This project serves as a personal resume implemented as a REST API, with the backend built using Next.js and API routes, and the simple 
frontend using Reactjs, which acts as a simple documentation to use the resume API. It will show my resume details in a JSON based response.

The app is deployed through Vercel and the documentation can be accessed here : https://ashrafazmy-resume-api.vercel.app/
